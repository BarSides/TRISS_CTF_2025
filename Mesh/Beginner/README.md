## Overview
This year, TRISS is proud to announce TrissMesh, a state of the art Meshtastic network!* Nodes have been placed at the check-in and CTF organizer booths for convenient wireless access from anywhere in the conference. Just connect to the channel 'Triss Mesh' with the pre-shared key and experience the possibilities of decentralized LoRa communications!

*TrissMesh restricted to authorized CTF personnel only

## Setup
No digital setup. Requires two Meshtastic nodes, one placed at the CTF booth and one placed at the registration booth. These nodes should both have the channel 'Triss Mesh' configured with pre-shared key 'QmFyU2lkZXN7bjB0czBzM2NyM3RrM3l9'. Tell the registration booth that anyone may attempt to connect to that node. If anyone tries to connect to the node at the CTF booth, shoo them away and tell them "for authorized personnel only".
