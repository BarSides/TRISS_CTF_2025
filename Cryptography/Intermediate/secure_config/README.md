## Overview

I've decided to secure the xml config of my app to keep prying eyes out. A little XOR magic later, and now its completely unreadable. This crypto stuff is easy!

## Setup

Provide secure_config.zip as a download.

secure_config.zip contains 3 files:
1. config.enc
1. test_config.xml
1. test_config.enc

## Flag
